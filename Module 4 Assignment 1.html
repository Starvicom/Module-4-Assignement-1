            <p class="underline">What I Have Learnt So Far</p>
      <p>
        I have learnt how to link my CSS to my HTML. Also i learnt about the cascading hierachy, box model and major CSS properties which include comment, colors, background properties, positions, shorthand property, border, margin, padding, CSS height, width and maximun width, outline, outline style, text alignment and text decoration.
      </p>
      <p class="underline">How CSS is Important</p>
      <p>
        CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for
        user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places
        and well organized, user experience improves.With CSS, you can apply
        specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string
        of code. One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several
        website pages. If, for instance, you have product pages that should all
        have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page
        will suffice for all pages of that same type.

        <p class="underline">Differences between Paddings, Margins and Borders</p>
        <p>
          <b> Margin - </b>It is the space around an element. Margins are used to move an
          element up or down on a page as well as left or right. Margin is
          completely transparent, and it does not have any background color.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Padding -</b> It is the space between the element and the related content
          inside it. It determines how elements look and sit within a container.
          It also shows the container background around the element in it.
          Padding can be affected by background colors as it clears the area
          around the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Border -</b> The perimeter of the box. Borders can be invisible or they
          could be a thick colored line like the green one pictured above.
